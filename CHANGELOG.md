# Changelog

## 4.0.2

- Fix reference to ItemStatus var in processingFiles method.

## 4.0.1

- Fix problem where window resize handler was removed incorrectly resulting in an error.


## 4.0.0

Multiple improvements, small fixes and new features. As updating will result in animation speed changes, changes to the way files are added to the files list, and will require an update of the image preview plugin, the version has been bumped to 4.0.0

- Add grid layout feature. Assign a fixed width to a filepond item and FilePond will render the items in rows.

The code below will render a list view on small viewports, a 50/50 grid on medium viewports, and a 33/33/33 grid on wide viewports. The `.5em` in each calc statement is equivalent to the combined left and right margin of each filepond item.

```css
@media (min-width: 30em) {
    .filepond--item {
        width: calc(50% - .5em);
    }
}

@media (min-width: 50em) {
    .filepond--item {
        width: calc(33.33% - .5em);
    }
}
```

- Add `styleItemPanelAspectRatio` to control the item panel aspect ratio and render item panels in a fixed size.
- Add `sort` method on FilePond instance for sorting FilePond files.
- Add `itemInsertLocation` property to set default insert location of files or sort method.
- Add `itemInsertInterval` to control the small delay between adding items to the files list.
- Improve drag and drop performance.
- Improve file insert logic and performance.
- Improve rendering of file previews will now scale correctly when window is resized.
- Improve handling of dropped directories on Firefox, file type was missing, now guestimates file type based on file extension.
- Small tweaks and changes to file animation durations and intros.
- Fixed drag coordinates being slightly out of place.
- Multiple small fixes and code improvements.


## 3.9.0

- Add `checkValidity` which is set to `false` by default. If it's set to `true`, FilePond will set the contents of the `labelInvalidField` property as the field custom validity message if it contains invalid files (files that for instance exceed max file size or fail other tests).


## 3.8.2

- Fix problem where remove server error message was passed directly to client without label. Set `labelFileRemoveError` to a string to change default error, set it to a function to show custom server error. `{ labelFileRemoveError: serverError => serverError }`


## 3.8.1

- Expose `dispatch` call to plugin item extensions.


## 3.8.0

- Add `forceRevert` option, set to `true` to force a revert action to finish before continuing.


## 3.7.7

- Improve `onlistupdate` event so it can be better synced with adapter components.


## 3.7.6

- Switched browse text underline to `text-decoration-skip-ink: auto` instead of `text-decoration-skip: ink` to prevent eslint warnings.


## 3.7.5

- Fix problem where calling `processFiles` without arguments would re-process already processed files.


## 3.7.4

- Fix problem where subsequent calls to `processFile` would not automatically revert an uploaded file or abort an active upload.


## 3.7.3

- Fix problem where upload complete indicator would not show when image preview was active.


## 3.7.2

- Expose `createItemAPI` to plugins.


## 3.7.1

- Fix problem where URLs would immidiately be in processed state.


## 3.7.0

- Add `maxParallelUploads` option to limit the amount of files being uploaded in parallel.
- Add option to only fetch file head when downloading remote URLs. File is downloaded to the server and server sends a unique file id to the client. Set `server.fetch.method` to `'HEAD'` the server needs to repond with custom header `X-Content-Transfer-Id` and a unique id. See [handle_fetch_remote_file](https://github.com/pqina/filepond-server-php/blob/master/index.php#L91) in FilePond PHP Server for an example implementation.


## 3.6.0

- Add support for uploading transform plugin variants.
- Add `server.process.ondata` which allows adding entries to the formdata before it's sent to the server.


## 3.5.1

- Fix problem where `processFile` and `processFiles` would reprocess already processed files.


## 3.5.0

- Add `beforeAddFile` hook, this can be used to quickly validate files before they're being added.


## 3.4.0

- Add `server.remove` property, this property can be optionally set to a method to call when the remove button is tapped on a `local` file. This allows removing files from the server. Please note that allowing clients to remove files from the server is a potential security risk and requires extra caution.

By default the property is `null`. The advise is to not use this method and only make changes to the server after the parent form has been submitted. The form POST will contain all the loaded file names and relevant file data, it should be enough to determine the files to remove and the files to keep.


## 3.3.3

- Fix filename matching of content-disposition header when the filename is not wrapped in quotes.
- Fix problem where special characters in filename prevented a file from being added


## 3.3.2

## 3.2.1
